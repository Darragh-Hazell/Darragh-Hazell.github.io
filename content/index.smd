This website is my personal blog and programming devlog. 

The [blog]($link.page('blog')) serves as a dumping ground for my personal thoughts, 
programming related or otherwise. 

My [devlog]($link.page('devlog/2025')) will describe my personal programming projects 
and progress across the current year. 
For access to previous devlogs visit the [devlog archive]($link.page('devlog')).

To find more information about me, for either recruitment or stalker-ish reasons, please 
visit the [about]($link.page('about')) section.

Below are some of my projects if you want to have a geez:
