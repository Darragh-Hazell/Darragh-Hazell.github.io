I'm a Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working with multiple languages and frameworks
in industry, personal, and academic settings.

- **C#**, using Microsoft's .NET framework, for enterprise backend web development of REST 
APIs and MVC applications.
- **TypeScript** for large enterprise Angular web apps with both internal and external user 
facing components.
- **Zig**, used for personal programming projects and for this website.
- **Java**, specifically for the Spring Framework, within previous roles for development of
micro services and soap web APIs.
- **Python** utilised in numerous fields, including data analytics and visualisation, machine learning, 
and web apps. Notable frameworks and libraries include django, plotly, dash, pandas, numpy, and scipy. 

Passionate about both software development and design, especially for backend web and domain specific 
application development. Deeply interested in pursuing career paths that will allow me to work on 
challenging problems and implementations.
